This repository is for me to get a better understading of machine learning algorithms and methods. I will try to implement ones listed below only with python with a help of numpy library. 

- [x] Linear regression
- [ ] Logistic regression
- [ ] Decision trees
- [ ] Random forest
- [ ] k-NN
- [ ] SVM
- [ ] Bayes classifier
- [ ] Neural networks
